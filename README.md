Coding Conventions:

Brachets have to be normal (start at the same line as the function)

Naming Conventions:

Classes:
Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., CarModel, CustomerAccount).

Methods:
Use camelCase for method names (e.g., calculateTotalPrice, getUserInfo).

Variables:
Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., orderDetails, employeeSalary).
Choose meaningful and descriptive names.

Constants:
Use uppercase with underscores for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRY_COUNT, PI_VALUE).


Indentation and Spacing:

-Use consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces or a tab).
-Add a blank line between methods and a reasonable amount of whitespace to enhance readability.
-Brachets have to be normal (start at the same line as the function) {

}

Comments:

Add comments to explain complex algorithms, and code that might be unclear to others.
Keep comments up to date with the code changes.

Line Maze:

The Line Maze Game follows the game of Line Follower. In the game, players engage in the challenge of guiding a robot through a line maze from the starting point to the exit of the finish line. Using a variety of sensors, the robot must navigate the twists and turns of the line maze while avoiding dead ends. The robot needs to be programmed effectively to make intelligent decisions about taking which direction and when to change direction. It should have great accuracy to follow designated directions and avoid pauses. This game focuses on the time the robot spends on the journey to the exit and must complete the maze in the shortest time possible to earn maximum points.
