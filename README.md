# Coding Conventions:

Brackets have to be normal (start at the same line as the function)

## Naming Conventions:

### Classes:
Use PascalCase for class names (e.g., CarModel, CustomerAccount).

### Methods:
Use camelCase for method names (e.g., calculateTotalPrice, getUserInfo).

### Variables:
Use camelCase for variable names (e.g., orderDetails, employeeSalary).
Choose meaningful and descriptive names.

### Constants:
Use uppercase with underscores for constants (e.g., MAX_RETRY_COUNT, PI_VALUE).


## Indentation and Spacing:

-Use consistent indentation (typically 4 spaces or a tab).
-Add a blank line between methods and a reasonable amount of whitespace to enhance readability.
-Brachets have to be normal (start at the same line as the function) {

}

## Comments:

Add comments to explain complex algorithms, and code that might be unclear to others.
Keep comments up to date with the code changes.

# Line Maze:

The Line Maze Game follows the game of Line Follower. In the game, players engage in the challenge of guiding a robot through a line maze from the starting point to the exit of the finish line. Using a variety of sensors, the robot must navigate the twists and turns of the line maze while avoiding dead ends. The robot needs to be programmed effectively to make intelligent decisions about taking which direction and when to change direction. It should have great accuracy to follow designated directions and avoid pauses. This game focuses on the time the robot spends on the journey to the exit and must complete the maze in the shortest time possible to earn maximum points.


# Physical Maze:

The Physical Maze Game is the last part of the battle after the Line Maze Game. The bot must not only navigate through a maze without hitting any walls but also starts by picking up a cone at the beginning. As the race begins, the bot equipped with a sensor will use the right-hand method to find its way out within a time limit of 5 minutes. To succeed, the bot must be programmed to efficiently navigate the maze with the cone and reach the exit without any collisions. The goal is to complete the maze in the shortest time possible.


# Line Follower

The game begins with the line follower, it picks up an object and carries it to the end of the line. During the game, the robot must follow a line and carry the objective until the end. The robot puts down the objective and stops when it reaches the end of the line.
